# Markers [​](https://observablehq.com/plot/features/markers\#markers)

A **marker** defines a graphic drawn on vertices of a [line](https://observablehq.com/plot/marks/line) or [link](https://observablehq.com/plot/marks/link) mark.

js

```
Plot.plot({
  marks: [\
    Plot.ruleY([0]),\
    Plot.lineY(crimea, {x: "date", y: "deaths", stroke: "cause", marker: "circle"})\
  ]
})
```

The supported marker options are:

- **markerStart** \- the marker for the starting point of a line segment
- **markerMid** \- the marker for any intermediate point of a line segment
- **markerEnd** \- the marker for the end point of a line segment
- **marker** \- shorthand for setting the marker on all points

The following named markers are supported:

- _none_ (default) - no marker
- _arrow_ \- an arrowhead with _auto_ orientation
- _arrow-reverse_ \- an arrowhead with _auto-start-reverse_ orientation
- _dot_ \- a filled _circle_ without a stroke and 2.5px radius
- _circle_, equivalent to _circle-fill_ \- a filled circle with a white stroke and 3px radius
- _circle-stroke_ \- a hollow circle with a colored stroke and a white fill and 3px radius
- _tick_ [^0.6.12](https://github.com/observablehq/plot/releases/tag/v0.6.12 "added in v0.6.12") \- a small opposing line
- _tick-x_ [^0.6.12](https://github.com/observablehq/plot/releases/tag/v0.6.12 "added in v0.6.12") \- a small horizontal line
- _tick-y_ [^0.6.12](https://github.com/observablehq/plot/releases/tag/v0.6.12 "added in v0.6.12") \- a small vertical line

If **marker** is true, it defaults to _circle_. If **marker** is a function, it will be called with a given _color_ and must return an [SVG marker element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/marker).

The primary color of a marker is inherited from the _stroke_ of the associated mark. The _arrow_ marker is [automatically oriented](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/orient) such that it points in the tangential direction of the path at the position the marker is placed. The _circle_ markers are centered around the given vertex.

For lines whose [curve](https://observablehq.com/plot/features/curves) is not _linear_, markers are not necessarily drawn at the data positions given by **x** and **y**; marker placement is determined by the (possibly Bézier) path segments generated by the curve. To ensure that symbols are drawn at a given **x** and **y** position, consider using a [dot mark](https://observablehq.com/plot/marks/dot) instead.

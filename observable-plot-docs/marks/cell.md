# Cell mark [​](https://observablehq.com/plot/marks/cell\#cell-mark)

TIP

The cell mark is a variant of the [rect mark](https://observablehq.com/plot/marks/rect) for use when both dimensions are ordinal. See also the [bar mark](https://observablehq.com/plot/marks/bar).

The **cell mark** draws rectangles positioned in two ordinal dimensions. Hence, the plot’s _x_ and _y_ scales are [band scales](https://observablehq.com/plot/features/scales). Cells typically also have a **fill** color encoding.

For example, the heatmap below shows the decline of _The Simpsons_ after Season 9: high IMDb ratings are dark green, while low ratings are dark pink. (The worst episode ever — cue Comic Book Guy — is season 23’s [“Lisa Goes Gaga”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Goes_Gaga).)

The cell mark can be combined with the [group transform](https://observablehq.com/plot/transforms/group), which groups data by ordinal value. (The [bin transform](https://observablehq.com/plot/transforms/bin), on the other hand, is intended for quantitative data and is typically paired with the [rect mark](https://observablehq.com/plot/marks/rect).) The heatmap below shows the maximum observed temperature by month ( **y**) and date ( **x**) in Seattle from 2012 through 2015.

A one-dimensional cell is produced by specifying only **x** or only **y**. The plot below collapses the history of _The Simpsons_ to a single line.

INFO

Here the _x_-scale domain contains the _id_ of every episode. An ordinal scale by default draws a tick for every domain value; setting **ticks** to just the first episode of each season prevents overlapping labels. The **tickFormat** function finds the row corresponding to the episode id and returns the corresponding _season_ number.

One-dimensional cells can be a compact alternative to a bar chart, where the _fill_ color of the cell replaces the length of the bar. However, position is a more salient encoding and should be preferred to color if space is available.

Plot.cell(alphabet, {x: "letter", fill: "frequency"}).plot()

When ordinal data is regular, such as the yearly observations of the warming stripes below, use the **interval** scale option to enforce uniformity and show gaps for missing data. It can be set to a named interval such as _hour_ or _day_, a number for numeric intervals, a [d3-time interval](https://d3js.org/d3-time#_interval), or a custom implementation.

```
Plot.plot({
  x: {
    ticks: d3.ticks(...d3.extent(hadcrut, (d) => d.year), 10),
    tickFormat: "d",
    interval: 1, // recommended in case of missing data
    label: null

  color: {

  },
  marks: [\
    Plot.cell(hadcrut, {x: "year", fill: "anomaly"})\

TIP

When an ordinal scale domain has high cardinality, the **ticks** scale option can be used to specify which ticks to label. Alternatively, consider using a quantitative or temporal scale instead, as by switching to a [bar mark](https://observablehq.com/plot/marks/bar).

## Cell options [​](https://observablehq.com/plot/marks/cell\#cell-options)

In addition to the [standard mark options](https://observablehq.com/plot/features/marks#mark-options), including [insets](https://observablehq.com/plot/features/marks#insets) and [rounded corners](https://observablehq.com/plot/features/marks#rounded-corners), the following optional channels are supported:

- **x** \- the horizontal position; bound to the _x_ scale, which must be _band_
- **y** \- the vertical position; bound to the _y_ scale, which must be _band_

If **x** is not specified, the cell will span the full horizontal extent of the plot (or facet). Likewise if **y** is not specified, the cell will span the full vertical extent of the plot (or facet). Typically either **x**, **y**, or both are specified; use a [frame mark](https://observablehq.com/plot/marks/frame) to decorate the plot’s frame.

The **stroke** defaults to _none_. The **fill** defaults to _currentColor_ if the stroke is _none_, and to _none_ otherwise.

## cell( _data_, _options_) [​](https://observablehq.com/plot/marks/cell\#cell)

js

```
Plot.cell(simpsons, {x: "number_in_season", y: "season", fill: "imdb_rating"})
```

Returns a new cell with the given _data_ and _options_. If neither the **x** nor **y** options are specified, _data_ is assumed to be an array of pairs \[\[ _x₀_, _y₀_\], \[ _x₁_, _y₁_\], \[ _x₂_, _y₂_\], …\] such that **x** = \[ _x₀_, _x₁_, _x₂_, …\] and **y** = \[ _y₀_, _y₁_, _y₂_, …\].

## cellX( _data_, _options_) [​](https://observablehq.com/plot/marks/cell\#cellX)

js

```
Plot.cellX(simpsons.map((d) => d.imdb_rating))
```

Equivalent to [cell](https://observablehq.com/plot/marks/cell#cell), except that if the **x** option is not specified, it defaults to \[0, 1, 2, …\], and if the **fill** option is not specified and **stroke** is not a channel, the fill defaults to the identity function and assumes that _data_ = \[ _x₀_, _x₁_, _x₂_, …\].

## cellY( _data_, _options_) [​](https://observablehq.com/plot/marks/cell\#cellY)

js

```
Plot.cellY(simpsons.map((d) => d.imdb_rating))
```

Equivalent to [cell](https://observablehq.com/plot/marks/cell#cell), except that if the **y** option is not specified, it defaults to \[0, 1, 2, …\], and if the **fill** option is not specified and **stroke** is not a channel, the fill defaults to the identity function and assumes that _data_ = \[ _y₀_, _y₁_, _y₂_, …\].

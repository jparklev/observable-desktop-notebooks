# Grid mark [^0.6.3](https://github.com/observablehq/plot/releases/tag/v0.6.3 "added in v0.6.3") [​](https://observablehq.com/plot/marks/grid\#grid-mark)

The **grid mark** is a specially-configured [rule](https://observablehq.com/plot/marks/rule) for drawing an axis-aligned grid. Like the [axis mark](https://observablehq.com/plot/marks/axis), a grid mark is automatically generated by Plot when you use the **grid** scale option. But you can also declare a grid mark explicitly, for example to draw grid lines atop rather than below bars.

Show grid on top:

js

```
Plot.plot({
  x: {axis: "top", percent: true, grid: !atop},
  marks: [\
    Plot.barX(alphabet, {x: "frequency", y: "letter", sort: {y: "width"}}),\
    atop ? Plot.gridX({interval: 1, stroke: "white", strokeOpacity: 0.5}) : null,\
    Plot.ruleX([0])\
  ]
})
```

The **interval** option above instructs the grid lines to be drawn at unit intervals, _i.e._ whole percentages. As an alternative, you can use the **ticks** option to specify the desired number of ticks or the **tickSpacing** option to specify the desired separation between adjacent ticks in pixels.

js

```
Plot.gridX().plot({x: {type: "linear"}})
```

The color of the grid lines can be controlled with the **stroke** option (or the alias **color**). While this option is are typically set to a constant color (such as _red_ or the default _currentColor_), it can be specified as a channel to assign colors dynamically based on the associated tick value.

js

```
Plot.gridX(d3.range(101), {stroke: Plot.identity, strokeOpacity: 1}).plot()
```

You can set other [stroke options](https://observablehq.com/plot/features/marks#mark-options) to further customize the appearance, say for dashed strokes.

0.00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91.0

js

```
Plot.gridX({strokeDasharray: "2", strokeOpacity: 1}).plot({x: {type: "linear"}})
```

See the [axis mark](https://observablehq.com/plot/marks/axis) for more details and examples.

## Grid options [​](https://observablehq.com/plot/marks/grid\#grid-options)

The optional _data_ is an array of tick values — it defaults to the scale’s ticks. The grid mark draws a line for each tick value, across the whole frame.

The following options are supported:

- **strokeDasharray** \- the [stroke dasharray](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/stroke-dasharray) for dashed lines, defaults to null

The following options are supported as constant or data-driven channels:

- **stroke** \- the grid color, defaults to _currentColor_
- **strokeWidth** \- the grid’s line width, defaults to 1
- **strokeOpacity** \- the stroke opacity, defaults to 0.1
- **y1** \- the start of the line, a channel of _y_ positions
- **y2** \- the end of the line, a channel of _y_ positions

All the other common options are supported when applicable ( _e.g._, **title**).

## gridX( _data_, _options_) [​](https://observablehq.com/plot/marks/grid\#gridX)

js

```
Plot.gridX({strokeDasharray: "5,3"})
```

Returns a new _x_ grid with the given _options_.

## gridY( _data_, _options_) [​](https://observablehq.com/plot/marks/grid\#gridY)

js

```
Plot.gridY({strokeDasharray: "5,3"})
```

Returns a new _y_ grid with the given _options_.

## gridFx( _data_, _options_) [​](https://observablehq.com/plot/marks/grid\#gridFx)

js

```
Plot.gridFx({strokeDasharray: "5,3"})
```

Returns a new _fx_ grid with the given _options_.

## gridFy( _data_, _options_) [​](https://observablehq.com/plot/marks/grid\#gridFy)

js

```
Plot.gridFy({strokeDasharray: "5,3"})
```

Returns a new _fy_ grid with the given _options_.

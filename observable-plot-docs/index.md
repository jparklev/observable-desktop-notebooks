[**Marks** \\
\\
Plot doesn’t have chart types. Instead, it has layered geometric shapes such as bars, dots, and lines.](https://observablehq.com/plot/features/marks)

[**Scales** \\
\\
Scales map an abstract value such as time or temperature to a visual value such as position or color.](https://observablehq.com/plot/features/scales)

[**Transforms** \\
\\
Derive data on-the-fly while plotting, say to bin quantitative values or compute a rolling average.](https://observablehq.com/plot/features/transforms)

[**Facets** \\
\\
Small multiples facilitate comparison by repeating a plot across partitions of data.](https://observablehq.com/plot/features/facets)

[**Projections** \\
\\
Plot supports GeoJSON and D3’s spherical projection system for geographic maps.](https://observablehq.com/plot/features/projections)

[**Built with D3** \\
\\
Plot is built by the same team as D3. If you know some D3, you’ll be right at home with Plot.\\

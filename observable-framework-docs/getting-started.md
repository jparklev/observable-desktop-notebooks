# [Getting started](https://observablehq.com/framework/getting-started\#getting-started)

For an introduction, see [What is Framework?](https://observablehq.com/framework/what-is-framework)

Welcome! This tutorial will guide your first steps with Observable Framework by way of a hands-on exercise creating a dashboard of local weather. 🌦️

Framework is three things in one:

- a **local development server** that you use to preview apps locally during development, with instant updates as you save changes,
- a **static site generator** that compiles Markdown, JavaScript, and other sources and assets — alongside data snapshots generated by loaders — into a static site that you can host anywhere, and
- a **command-line interface** for automating builds & deploys so that you can quickly and securely share your app with whomever you like (your boss, your team, the world).

We’ll touch on each of these parts in this tutorial. It’ll go something like this:

cluster\_developdevelopcluster\_publishpublishcreatecreateediteditcreate->editpreviewpreviewedit->previewpreview->editbuildbuildpreview->builddeploydeploybuild->deployviewviewdeploy->view

First you’ll setup your local development environment by [**creating**](https://observablehq.com/framework/getting-started#1-create) a new project. A project contains all the source code needed to build an app. Next you’ll [**develop**](https://observablehq.com/framework/getting-started#2-develop): an iterative process where you save changes to source files in your editor while previewing the result in your browser. When you’re ready to share, it’s time to [**publish**](https://observablehq.com/framework/getting-started#3-publish): you build and deploy your static site to your preferred hosting provider.

These are just first steps. You can continue to develop apps after publishing, and republish as needed. You can also setup continuous deployment to publish your app automatically on commit or on schedule. We’ll cover these [next steps](https://observablehq.com/framework/getting-started#next-steps) briefly below.

## [1\. Create](https://observablehq.com/framework/getting-started\#1-create)

Framework includes a helper script (`observable create`) for creating new apps. After a few quick prompts — where to create the project, your preferred package manager, _etc._ — it will stamp out a fresh project from a template.

Framework is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) application published to npm. You must have [Node.js 18 or later](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed before you can install Framework. Framework is a command-line interface (CLI) that runs in the terminal.

If you run into difficulty following this tutorial, we’re happy to help! Please visit our [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/observablehq/framework/discussions).

To create a new app with npm, run:

```
npx @observablehq/framework@latest create
```

You can run the above command anywhere, but you may want to `cd` to your `~/Development` directory first (or wherever you do local development).

This command will ask you a series of questions in order to initialize your new app. For this tutorial, you can simply hit Enter to accept the default values. When you’re done, you should see something like this:

```
┌   observable create

```

And that’s it! Your new app is ready to go. 🎉

## [2\. Develop](https://observablehq.com/framework/getting-started\#2-develop)

Next, `cd` into your new project.

```
cd hello-framework
```

Framework’s local development server lets you preview your app in the browser as you make rapid changes. The preview server generates pages on the fly: as you edit files in your editor, changes are instantly streamed to your browser.

To start the preview server using npm:

```
npm run dev
```

Or with Yarn:

```
yarn dev
```

You should see something like this:

```
Observable Framework v1.13.3
↳ http://127.0.0.1:3000/
```

If port 3000 is in use, the preview server will choose the next available port, so your actual port may vary. To specify a different port, use `--port`. For example, to run the preview server with npm on port 4321:

```sh
npm run dev -- --port 4321
```

For security, the preview server is by default only accessible on your local machine using the [loopback address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localhost) 127.0.0.1. To allow remote connections, use `--host 0.0.0.0`.

Port numbers below 1024 may need admin privileges. For example, to share your preview server on the default HTTP port 80:

```sh
sudo npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0 --port 80
```

Now visit [http://127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000/) in your browser, which should look like:

![](https://observablehq.com/framework/_file/getting-started/hello-framework.19f17a99.webp)The default home page (`src/index.md`) after creating a new app.

### [Test live preview](https://observablehq.com/framework/getting-started\#test-live-preview)

Live preview means that as you save changes, your in-browser preview updates instantly. Live preview applies to Markdown pages, imported JavaScript modules (so-called _hot module replacement_), data loaders, page loaders, and file attachments. This feature is implemented by the preview server watching files and pushing changes to the browser over a socket.

To experience live preview, open `src/index.md` in your preferred text editor — below we show Zed — and position your browser window so that you can see your editor and browser side-by-side. If you then replace the text “Hello Framework” with “Hi, Mom!” and save, you should see:

![](https://observablehq.com/framework/_file/getting-started/hi-mom.cc201f6d.webp)No seriously — hi, Mom! Thanks for supporting me all these years.

### [Create a new page](https://observablehq.com/framework/getting-started\#create-a-new-page)

Now let’s add a page for our weather dashboard. Create a new file `src/weather.md` and paste in the following snippet:

````md
# Weather report

```js
display(1 + 2);
```
````

To see the new page in the sidebar, reload the page.

If you click on the **Weather report** link in the sidebar, it’ll take you to [http://127.0.0.1:3000/weather](http://127.0.0.1:3000/weather), where you should see:

![](https://observablehq.com/framework/_file/getting-started/hello-weather.1c101f09.webp)The humble beginnings of a local weather dashboard.

The sidebar is hidden by default in narrow windows. If you don’t see the sidebar, you can show it by making the window wider, or using Command-B (⌘B) or Option-B (⌥B) on Firefox and non-macOS, or clicking the right-pointing arrow ↦ on the left edge of the window.

As evidenced by the code `1 + 2` rendered as `3`, JavaScript fenced code blocks (``````js```) are _live_: the code runs in the browser. Try replacing `2` with `Math.random()`, and the code will re-run automatically on save. In a bit, we’ll write code to render a chart. We can also use code to debug as we develop, say to inspect data.

### [Data loader](https://observablehq.com/framework/getting-started\#data-loader)

Next, let’s load some data. The [National Weather Service (NWS)](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api) provides an excellent and free API for local weather data within the United States. We’ll use the `/points/[latitude],[longitude]` endpoint to get metadata for the closest grid point to the given location, and then fetch the corresponding hourly forecast.

Create a new file `src/data/forecast.json.js` and paste in the following snippet:

```js
const longitude = -122.47;
const latitude = 37.80;

async function json(url) {
  const response = await fetch(url);
  if (!response.ok) throw new Error(`fetch failed: ${response.status}`);
  return await response.json();
}

const station = await json(`https://api.weather.gov/points/${latitude},${longitude}`);
const forecast = await json(station.properties.forecastHourly);

process.stdout.write(JSON.stringify(forecast));
```

Locate me

To personalize this code snippet to your current location, edit the `longitude` and `latitude` values above, or click the **Locate me** button above.

NWS does not provide forecasts for points outside the United States. If you specify such a location the API will error and the data loader will fail.

If you would rather write your data loader in Python, R, or some other language, take a peek at the [next steps](https://observablehq.com/framework/getting-started#next-steps) below before continuing.

Your data loader should look like this:

![](https://observablehq.com/framework/_file/getting-started/hello-loader.c4df7d49.webp)A JavaScript data loader for fetching a local forecast from weather.gov.

If you like, you can run your data loader manually in the terminal:

```
node src/data/forecast.json.js
```

If this barfs a bunch of JSON in the terminal, it’s working as intended. 😅 Normally you don’t run data loaders by hand — Framework runs them automatically, as needed — but data loaders are “just” programs so you can run them manually if you want. Conversely, any executable or shell script that runs on your machine and outputs something to stdout can be a data loader!

### [File attachments](https://observablehq.com/framework/getting-started\#file-attachments)

Framework uses [file-based routing](https://observablehq.com/framework/data-loaders#routing) for data loaders: the data loader `forecast.json.js` serves the file `forecast.json`. To load this file from `src/weather.md` we use the relative path `./data/forecast.json`. In effect, data loaders are simply a naming convention for generating “static” files — a big advantage of which is that you can edit a data loader and the changes immediately propagate to the live preview without needing a reload.

To load a file in JavaScript, use the built-in [`FileAttachment`](https://observablehq.com/framework/files). In `weather.md`, replace the contents of the JavaScript code block (the parts inside the triple backticks `````````) with the following code:

```js
const forecast = FileAttachment("./data/forecast.json").json();
```

`FileAttachment` is a special function that can only be passed a static string literal as an argument. This restriction enables static analysis, allowing Framework to determine which data loaders to run on build and improving security by only including referenced files in the published app.

You can now reference the variable `forecast` from other code. For example, you can add another code block that displays the `forecast` data.

````md
```js
display(forecast);
```
````

This looks like:

![](https://observablehq.com/framework/_file/getting-started/hello-data.275d40a2.webp)Using `FileAttachment` to load data.

The built-in [`display`](https://observablehq.com/framework/javascript#explicit-display) function displays the specified value, a bit like `console.log` in the browser’s console. As you can see below, `display` is called [implicitly](https://observablehq.com/framework/javascript#implicit-display) when a code block contains an expression:

3

```js
1 + 2
```

For convenience, here’s a copy of the data so you can explore it here:

Object {@context: Array(2), type: "Feature", geometry: Object, properties: Object}

This is a GeoJSON `Feature` object of a `Polygon` geometry representing the grid square. The `properties` object within contains the hourly forecast data. You can display it on a map with [Leaflet](https://observablehq.com/framework/lib/leaflet), if you like.

This grid point covers the south end of the Golden Gate Bridge.

### [Plots](https://observablehq.com/framework/getting-started\#plots)

Now let’s add a chart using [Observable Plot](https://observablehq.com/framework/lib/plot). Framework includes a variety of [recommended libraries](https://observablehq.com/framework/imports#implicit-imports) by default, including `Plot`, and you can always [import more](https://observablehq.com/framework/imports) from npm. Replace the `display(forecast)` code block with the following code:

```js
display(
  Plot.plot({
    title: "Hourly temperature forecast",
    x: {type: "utc", ticks: "day", label: null},
    y: {grid: true, inset: 10, label: "Degrees (F)"},
    marks: [\
      Plot.lineY(forecast.properties.periods, {\
        x: "startTime",\
        y: "temperature",\
        z: null, // varying color, not series\
        stroke: "temperature",\
        curve: "step-after"\
      })\
    ]
  })
);
```

Because this is JSON data, `startTime` is a `string` rather than a `Date`. Setting the `type` of the `x` scale to `utc` tells Plot to interpret these values as temporal rather than ordinal.

You should now see:

![](https://observablehq.com/framework/_file/getting-started/hello-plot.ea32cee1.webp)Using `Plot` to make a chart.

Try editing `forecast.json.js` to change the `longitude` and `latitude` to a different location! After you save, Framework will run the data loader again and push the new data to the client to update the chart. For example, to see the current forecast at the White House:

```js
const longitude = -77.04;
const latitude = 38.90;
```

As before, the code block contains an expression (a call to `Plot.plot`) and hence `display` is called implicitly. And since this expression evaluates to a DOM element (a `<figure>` containing an `<svg>`), `display` inserts the element directly into the page. We didn’t have to touch the DOM API!

### [Components](https://observablehq.com/framework/getting-started\#components)

As pages grow, complex inline JavaScript may become unwieldy and repetitive. Tidy code by moving it into functions. In Framework, a function that returns a DOM element is called a _component_.

To turn the chart above into a component, wrap it in a function and promote the `data` to a required argument. Accept any named options (such as `width`) as an optional second argument with destructuring.

```js
function temperaturePlot(data, {width} = {}) {
  return Plot.plot({
    title: "Hourly temperature forecast",
    width,
    x: {type: "utc", ticks: "day", label: null},
    y: {grid: true, inset: 10, label: "Degrees (F)"},
    marks: [\
      Plot.lineY(data.properties.periods, {\
        x: "startTime",\
        y: "temperature",\
        z: null, // varying color, not series\
        stroke: "temperature",\
        curve: "step-after"\
      })\
    ]
  });
}
```

Now you can call `temperaturePlot` to display the forecast anywhere on the page:

```js
display(temperaturePlot(forecast));
```

JavaScript can be extracted into standalone modules (`.js` files) that you can [import](https://observablehq.com/framework/imports) into Markdown. This lets you share code across pages, write unit tests for components, and more.

### [Layout](https://observablehq.com/framework/getting-started\#layout)

Let’s put some finishing touches on and wrap up this tutorial.

While this nascent dashboard only has a single chart on it, most dashboards will have many charts, tables, values, and other elements. To assist layout, Framework includes simple `grid` and `card` CSS classes with 1, 2, 3, or 4 columns. (You can write more elaborate custom styles if needed, or load your preferred CSS framework.)

For example, here’s a two-column grid with three cards:

one–two

three

four

```html
<div class="grid grid-cols-2">
  <div class="card grid-colspan-2">one–two</div>
  <div class="card">three</div>
  <div class="card">four</div>
</div>
```

Framework’s grid is responsive: on narrow windows, the two-column grid will automatically collapse to a one-column grid. Cells in a grid have the same height by default (using `grid-auto-rows`), so consider separate `<div class="grid">` containers if you want to vary row height.

When placing charts in a grid, you typically want to render responsively based on the width (and sometimes height) of the containing cell. Framework’s `resize` helper takes a render function returning a DOM element and re-renders whenever the container resizes. It looks like this:

## Hourly temperature forecast

5051525354555657585960↑ Degrees (F)26Mar2728293031

```html
<div class="grid grid-cols-1">
  <div class="card">${resize((width) => temperaturePlot(forecast, {width}))}</div>
</div>
```

Lastly, let’s apply the `dashboard` [theme](https://observablehq.com/framework/themes) and disable the table of contents (`toc`) using [YAML front matter](https://observablehq.com/framework/markdown#front-matter). The `dashboard` theme allows the main column to span the full width of the window; without it, the main column width is limited to 1152px as appropriate for documentation or a report.

```yaml
---
theme: dashboard
toc: false
---
```

![](https://observablehq.com/framework/_file/getting-started/hello-grid.0d5e9088.webp)Adopting a grid layout and the `dashboard` theme.

_Ta-da!_ 🎉 Perhaps not the most exciting dashboard yet, but it has potential! Try exploring other data in the NWS forecast and adding more charts. For example, you could visualize precipitation probability.

## [3\. Publish](https://observablehq.com/framework/getting-started\#3-publish)

When you’re ready to share your app, you can quickly build and deploy it to your preferred hosting provider, such as GitHub Pages.

To build your app with npm, run:

```
npm run build
```

Or with Yarn:

```
yarn build
```

The `build` command generates the `dist` directory; you can then upload this directory to your preferred hosting provider or copy it to your static site server for self-hosting. To preview your built app locally, you can use a local static HTTP server such as [http-server](https://github.com/http-party/http-server):

```
npx http-server dist
```

By default, Framework generates “clean” URLs by dropping the \`.html\` extension from page links. Not all webhosts support this; some need the [**preserveExtension** config option](https://observablehq.com/framework/config#preserve-extension) set to true.

When deploying to GitHub Pages without using GitHub’s related actions ( [configure-pages](https://github.com/actions/configure-pages),
[deploy-pages](https://github.com/actions/deploy-pages), and
[upload-pages-artifact](https://github.com/actions/upload-pages-artifact)), you may need to create a `.nojekyll` file in your `dist` folder after building. See GitHub’s documentation on [static site generators](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#static-site-generators) for more.

To deploy your app to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions, read our [Deploying guide](https://observablehq.com/framework/deploying).

## [Next steps](https://observablehq.com/framework/getting-started\#next-steps)

Here are a few more tips.

### [Write a data loader in Python, R, or other language](https://observablehq.com/framework/getting-started\#write-a-data-loader-in-python-r-or-other-language)

We coded exclusively in JavaScript for this tutorial, but you can write data loaders in any language — not just JavaScript. Here’s a `forecast.json.py` you could use in place of the JavaScript data loader [above](https://observablehq.com/framework/getting-started#data-loader):

```py
import json
import requests
import sys

longitude = -122.47
latitude = 37.80

station = requests.get(f"https://api.weather.gov/points/{latitude},{longitude}").json()
forecast = requests.get(station["properties"]["forecastHourly"]).json()

json.dump(forecast, sys.stdout)
```

To write the data loader in R, name it `forecast.json.R`. Or as shell script, `forecast.json.sh`. You get the idea. See [Data loaders: Routing](https://observablehq.com/framework/data-loaders#routing) for more. The beauty of this approach is that you can leverage the strengths (and libraries) of multiple languages, and still get instant updates in the browser as you develop.

### [Deploy automatically](https://observablehq.com/framework/getting-started\#deploy-automatically)

You can schedule builds and deploy your app automatically on commit, or on a schedule. See [deploying](https://observablehq.com/framework/deploying) for more details.

### [Update Framework](https://observablehq.com/framework/getting-started\#update-framework)

To update your app’s dependencies — in particular when a new [release](https://github.com/observablehq/framework/releases) of Framework is available, `cd` into the project and run:

```
npm update
```

or

```
yarn upgrade
```

(See the reference for [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-update) and [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/upgrade/).)

### [Ask for help, or share your feedback](https://observablehq.com/framework/getting-started\#ask-for-help-or-share-your-feedback)

Please reach out if you have questions or thoughts! You can start a [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/observablehq/framework/discussions) to ask for help or share your work, or file a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/observablehq/framework/issues) to report a bug or request a feature.
